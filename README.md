Internet relay chat server which written in Golang.


Background
====

IRC is an awesome protocol, it's simple but very mature in the past decades. 

From my perspective, some of its features which defined in the RFC are out of date, so I wanna to implement a modern IRC server with usefull features, of course, I will extend the original IRC as well. 


Quick Start
====

I assume you already familiar with how to install go related packages.

1. Install the code ```go get github.com/flatpeach/ircd```
2. Prepare your ```ircd.conf```, you can consult the default ```ircd.conf``` in this repo
3. Start your irc server ```ircd --config my_config_file_path```

Enjoy to chat with this IRC server.
